# Raft (2014)

## Abstract
- Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos.
- Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered.
- Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety

## 1. Introduction
- Consensus algorithms allow a collection of machines to work as a coherent group that can survive the failures of some of its members.
- Paxos has dominated the discussion of consensus algorithms over the last decade: most implementations of consensus are based on Paxos of influenced by it. But it is quite difficult to understand
- Raft is similar to many ways to existing consensus algorithms, but it has several novel features:
  - **Strong leader**: Raft uses a stronger form of leadership then other consensus algorithms. For example, log entries only flow from the leader to other servers. This simplifies the management of the replicated log and makes Raft easier to understand.
  - **Leader election**: Raft uses randomized timers to elect leaders. This adds only a small amount of mechanism to the heartbeats already required for any consensus algorithm, while resolving conflicts simply and rapidly
  - **Membership changes**: Raft's mechanism for changing the set of servers in the cluster uses a new join consensus approach where the majorities of two different configurations overlap during transitions. This allows the cluster to continue operating normally during configuration changes

## 2. Replicated state machines
- Consensus algorithms typically arise in the context of replicated state machines. In this approach, state machines on a collection of servers compute identical copies of the same state and can continue operating even if some of the servers are down. Replicated state machines are used to solve a variety of fault tolerance problems in distributed systems
- Replicated state machines are typically implemented using a replicated log. Each server stores a log containing a series of commands, which its state machine executes in order. Each log contains the same commands in the same order, so each state machine processes the same sequence of commands. Since the state machines are deterministic, each computes the same state and the same sequence of outputs

- Keeping the replicated log consistent is the job of the consensus algorithm. The consensus module on a server receives commands from clients and adds them to its log. It communicates with the consensus modules on other servers to ensure that every log eventually contains the same requests in the same order, even if some servers fail. Once commands are properly replicated, each server's state machine processes them in log order, and the outputs are returned to clients.
- Consensus algorithms for practical systems typically have the following properties:
  - They ensure safety under all non-Byzantine conditions, including network delays, partitions, and packet loss, duplication, and reordering
  - They are fully functional as long as any majority of the servers are operational and can communicate with each other and with clients. Thus, a typical cluster of five servers can tolerate the failure of any two servers. Servers are assumed to fail by stopping; they may later recover from state on stable storage and rejoin the cluster.
  - They do not depend on timing to ensure the consistency of the logs: faulty clocks and extreme message delays can, at worst, cause availability problems.
  - In the common case, a command can complete as soon as a majority of the cluster has responded to a single round of remote procedure calls; a minority of slow servers need not impact overall system performance.

## 3. What's wrong with Paxos?
- Complexity: Paxos is notoriously difficult to understand.
- Practical Implementation: Paxos does not provide a good foundation for building practical systems.

## 4. Designing for understandability
- Problem Decomposition: They divided the consensus problem into separate components that could be solved and understood independently.
- State Space Reduction: They simplified the state space by reducing the number of states to consider, making the system more coherent and eliminating nondeterminism where possible.

## 5. The Raft consensus algorithm
- Raft is an algorithm for managing a replicated log
- Raft implements consensus by first electing a distinguished *leader*, then giving the leader complete responsibility for managing the replicated log. The leader accepts log entries from clients, replicates them on other servers, and tells servers when it is safe to apply log entries to their state machines. Having a leader simplifies the management of the replicated log.
- Given the leader approach. Raft decomposes the consensus problem into three relatively independent subproblems, which are discussed in the subsections that follow:
  - **Leader election**: a new leader must be chosen when an existing leader fails
  - **Log replication**: the leader must accept log entries from clients and replicate them across the cluster, forcing the other logs to agree with its own
  - **Safety**: the key safety property for Raft is the State Machine Safety Property in Figure 3: if any server has applied a particular log entry to its state machine, then no other server may apply a different command for the same log index

## 5.1. Raft basics
- A Raft cluster contains several server; five is a typical number, which allows the system tolerate two failures.

- At any given time each server is in one of three states: *leader, follower, or candidate*. There is exactly one leader and all of the other servers are followers:
  - Followers are passive
  - The leader handles all client requests
  - The third statem candidate, is used to elect a new leader
- Raft divides time into terms of arbitrary length. Terms are numbered with consecutive integers. Each term begins with an election, in which one or more candidates attempt to become leader. If a candidate wins the election, then it serves as leader for the rest of the term
- Raft ensures that there is at most one leader in a given term.
- Raft servers communicate using remote procedure calls (RPCs), and the basic consensus algorithm requires only two types of RPCs.
  - RequestVote RPCs are initiated by candidates during elections
  - AppendEntries RPCs are initiated by leaders to replicate log entries and to provide a form of heartbeat

## 5.2 Leader election
- Raft uses a heartbeat mechanism to trigger leader election. When servers start up, they begin as followers. A server remains in follower state as long as it receives valid RPCs from a leader or candidate. Leaders send periodic heartbeats(AppendEntries RPCs that carry no log entries) to all followers in order to maintain their authority. If a follower receives no communication over a period of time called the *election timeout*, then it assumes there is no viable leader and begins an election to choose a new leader.
- To begin an election, a follower increments its current term and transitions to candidate state. It then votes for itself and issues RequestVote RPCs in parallel to each of the other servers in the cluster. A candidate continues in this state until one of three things happens: 
  - (a) it wins the election
  - (b) another server establishes itself as leader
  - (c) a priod of time goes by with no winner
- A candidate wins an elections if it receives votes from a majority of the servers in the full cluster for the same term
- Each server will vote for at most one candidate in a given term, on a first-come-first-served basis
- The majority rule ensures that at most one candidate can win the election for a particuler term
- Once a candidate wins a election, it becomes leader. It then sends heartbeat messages to all of the other servers to establish its authority and prevent new elections.
- If a candidate receives an AppendEntries RPC from another server claiming to be leader, it returns to follower state if the leader's term is at least as large as its current term.
- Raft uses randomized election timeouts to ensure that split votes are rare and that they are resolved quickly
